  WBC: "White Blood Cell count. Indicates immune system activity. High levels may suggest infection or inflammation, while low levels may indicate immune deficiency.",
  LYMp: "Lymphocyte percentage. Reflects the proportion of lymphocytes among white blood cells. Important in fighting viral infections.",
  NEUTp:
    "Neutrophil percentage. Indicates the proportion of neutrophils in white blood cells. High levels are typically seen in bacterial infections.",
  LYMn: "Lymphocyte absolute count. Represents the actual number of lymphocytes per microliter of blood.",
  NEUTn:
    "Neutrophil absolute count. Shows the exact number of neutrophils, useful for diagnosing infections or inflammatory conditions.",
  RBC: "Red Blood Cell count. Measures the number of red blood cells, which carry oxygen. Low levels may indicate anemia.",
  HGB: "Hemoglobin concentration. Indicates the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Crucial for diagnosing anemia.",
  HCT: "Hematocrit. Reflects the proportion of blood volume occupied by red blood cells. Low levels suggest anemia.",
  MCV: "Mean Corpuscular Volume. Shows the average size of red blood cells. Helps differentiate types of anemia.",
  MCH: "Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin. Represents the average amount of hemoglobin per red blood cell.",
  MCHC: "Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration. Indicates the concentration of hemoglobin in red blood cells.",
  PLT: "Platelet count. Critical for blood clotting. Low levels can cause bleeding issues; high levels may indicate clotting risk.",
  PDW: "Platelet Distribution Width. Measures the variation in platelet size, often used to assess bone marrow activity.",
  PCT: "Plateletcrit. Reflects the total platelet mass in the blood, combining count and size.",
